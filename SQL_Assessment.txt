Question1: 

id   name
1   John Doe
4	Bobby Louis
5	Lisa Romero

Issue with "SELECT * FROM runners WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT winner_id FROM races)", is that it may not handle NULL values in the winner_id column of the races table correctly. 

Alternate query can be using JOINs:

SELECT r.*
FROM runners r
LEFT JOIN races ra ON r.id = ra.winner_id
WHERE ra.winner_id IS NULL;

Question2:

SELECT ta.*
FROM test_a ta
LEFT JOIN test_b tb ON ta.id = tb.id
WHERE tb.id IS NULL;

Question 3:

SELECT u.username, COUNT(*) AS num_lessons_taken
FROM users u
INNER JOIN training_details t ON(u.user_id = t.user_id)
GROUP BY u.username, t.traning_date
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY t.traning_date DESC

Question 4:

SELECT e.Manager_Id, e.Emp_name as Manager, avg(e1.salary as Average_Salary_Under_Manager
FROM employee e
INNER JOIN employee e1 ON e.Emp_Id = e1.Manager_Id
GROUP BY e1.Manager_Id
